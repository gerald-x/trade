# Trade
A dummy trade application. It uses `Django background tasks` to simulate the process of prices of goods changing in the background automatically. 
The prices are calculated using Python's `random` module, allowing users to buy or sell dummy stocks to increase or decrease their portfolio. 
The Frontend is built using `HTML`, `CSS` and `js` with additional libraries
